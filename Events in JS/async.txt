Default JS Behaviour :-
JS is synchronous. One after the other code execution.
It's a single threaded Language. JS Engine is Single Threaded

execution contect :-

one line at at a time

Blocking Code vs Non Blocking Code:-

Blocks the flow of the program. -> Read File Sync
Don't blocks the flow of the program. ->Read File Async

JS Engine -> Memory Heap and CALL Stack.
Call stack has all fxn calls if it has anything like settimeout or setInterval it goes to runtime Environment -> node OR weB API. It puts them in a task queue and then executed .


fetch()  has a high priority so quese a high priority task queue.
